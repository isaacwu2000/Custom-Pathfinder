# Custom Pathfinder
Given a nxn array of random integers, this program can find the cheapest path from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. 
## Method
The Custom Pathfinder can directly search for a path where the User can only go right, down, or diagonal or in all 8 directions with some optimizations (e.g. ending the search of a path when it exceeds the minimum cost and beginning the search with the shortest path â€” the straight diagonal).

In addition, the Custom Pathfinder can find the optimal path (where the User can only go right, down, or diagonal) using a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm.
